Professional PDF Response & Logging
I should implement Logging.

Why: If an extraction fails, i need to know exactly which line of the PDF caused the crash without looking at the terminal.

The Task: Add Python's logging module to your script to record every successful invoice processed in a local file or a cloud monit
